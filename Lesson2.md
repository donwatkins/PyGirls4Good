# Strings, lists and the turtle
Lists are more powerful than strings. Lists are enclosed in brackets []. A list might contain all the students in this class. [
* class_list = ["Kathy", "Marla", "Margaret"]
* colors = ["red", "blue", "orange"]
### We can add to a list.
*Use the 'class_list.append() command.

## Your first program
Entering code in the REPL can give us immediate feedback but we need to write the code down and save it. Our first program will be to say "Hello World." After entering the code we want to click on the 'Save' button at the top of Mu. 
![Hello World](https://github.com/donwatkins/PyGirls4Good/blob/master/Images/MyFirstProgram.png)
### After clicking on the 'Save' button you will see a dialog box and you will be given the opportunity to save your file. A good name might be 'first.py.' When saving Python programs be sure to end with the file extension '.py'.

### After saving the program then click on the 'Run' button to see the output of your program. 

## Turtle function
There are many functions in Python. We have already used the 'print' function. Now we are going to use the 'turtle' function. We have to import it first. We do that by entering 'import turtle' in the REPL.
