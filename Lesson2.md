# Strings, lists and the turtle
Lists are more powerful than strings. Lists are enclosed in brackets []. A list might contain all the students in this class. [
* class_list = ["Kathy", "Marla", "Margaret"]
* colors = ["red", "blue", "orange"]
### We can add to a list.
*Use the 'class_list.append() command.

## Your first program
Entering code in the REPL can give us immediate feedback but we need to write the code down and save it. Our first program will be to say "Hello World."
