# Fun with the Turtle and other Python functions

### In the last lesson we learned how to use the 'turtle' function to draw a square, a spiral, and differently colored spirals. 
Now we are going to learn more. In an earlier lesson we learned that we can create variables that are made up of a list of objects. Now we are going to create a list of colors that we are going to use to create a four color spiral. Remember a list is contained in [] brackets. Here is our plan

1.Import the turtle module and set up a turtle.
2. Tell the computer which colors weâ€™d like to use.
3. Set up a loop to draw 100 lines in our spiral.
4. Pick a different pen color for each side of the spiral.
5. Move the turtle forward to draw each side.
6. Turn the turtle left to get ready to draw the next side.

```python
colors = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green"]
```
