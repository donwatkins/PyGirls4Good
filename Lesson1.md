## Lesson 1
The Python programming language was named after the Monty
Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus TV show, not after python the snake.
According to [Python.org](https://python.org): "Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively."
### The Shell
Python commands are executed one line at a time. The action takes place in the Python shell. A typical Python shell looks like this.

Here's a code example executed in the Python shell.

### In this class we are going to use the Mu Editor which is designed for beginning programmers. 
The Mu Editor comes with the software included with your Raspberry Pi computer.
